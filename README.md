# ChromaFocus
An accessibility color strategy for web designers & developers that visually exposes the nature of the WCAG contrast algorithm (low vision target) and simulates various forms of colorblindness. 

The first release (ChromaFocus LITE) is designed as an basic contrast/colorblindness color-picker.
Its major features are:
## [#1] It visually superimposes a "Failure-Range" on color channel sliders. 
### Value of Feature:
Visual Feedback of passing color choices becomes clear. 
User can "see" what color choices are possible, instead of only knowing pass/results. If one can forgive the metaphor, it places a "sight" on the "gun" of color-picking when you are targeting a pair of colors that pass WCAG contrast requirements.

## [#2] The colorblind feature "splits" the slider's gradient, simulating colorblind perception of the said color.
### Value of Feature:
Visual Comparison Between Normal Vision and Colorblind Vision as a gradient.
While many color pickers show the effects of colorblindness on single color choices, ChromaFocus LITE shows the user the effects of making changes BEFORE making them. For example, when you look at the effects of Protanopia, it becomes clear that shifts in the red or blue channels will have only minor effect on outcomes, while value shifts in the green channel produce dramatic results.
